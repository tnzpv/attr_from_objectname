Addon for blender to manipulate object visibility and max_drawtype based on object name.

![Attr from Objects Names](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tnzpv/attr_from_objectname/master/images/ui.png)

Download it inside your addons folder and enable the add-on in Blender.  
The add-on is in the Animation Panel.

Objects are filtered by a regular expression search.  
It handles all mesh objects in blender file (even in groups).  
However, attributes overrides are not persistent with linked objects.
